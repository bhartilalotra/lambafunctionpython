Lambda Functions and String Operations:

Overview:

This Python script showcases various applications of lambda functions along with built-in string methods. It illustrates how to use lambda functions for arithmetic operations, string manipulations, and various string methods, providing a practical example of functional programming in Python.

Features:

Lambda Function Basics:

Demonstrates the syntax and usage of lambda functions for simple operations like addition and squaring numbers.

Types of Arguments:

Shows how lambda functions can accept named arguments, variable arguments, and keyword arguments.

String Manipulations:

Utilizes lambda functions to apply various string methods, including slicing, stripping, replacing, and formatting strings.
Implements operations such as find, count, lower, upper, capitalize, and checks for alphabetic, numeric, and alphanumeric characters.

Regular Expressions:

Uses the re library to demonstrate how to replace spaces with hyphens in strings using a lambda function.
Code Breakdown

Basic Arithmetic:

Uses lambda functions to perform simple arithmetic and demonstrate the use of multiple arguments.

String Operations:

Demonstrates various string methods wrapped in lambda functions, such as:

Slicing: Extracting parts of strings.

Strip Methods: Removing whitespace and specific characters.

Replacing Characters: Changing specific characters within a string.

Finding and Counting Characters: Locating and counting occurrences of characters in strings.

String Formatting:

Shows the use of join to concatenate elements of a list into a single string.

Regular Expressions:

Demonstrates how to use re.sub() to manipulate strings based on patterns.
